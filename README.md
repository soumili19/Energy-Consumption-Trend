# Energy-Consumption-Trend with Power BI
 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive dashboard built using Power BI to analyze and visualize energy consumption trends over time. It helps stakeholders understand key usage patterns, identify high consumption areas, and make informed decisions to reduce energy waste and optimize consumption.

#  Objectives
* Monitor and visualize energy usage across different time periods.
* Identify peak consumption hours, days, or seasons.
* Spot anomalies or sudden spikes in energy consumption.


#   Tools & Technologies Used
* **Power BI** – for dashboard creation and data visualization
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – for custom measures and KPIs
* **Power Query Editor** – for data transformation and cleaning
* **Microsoft Excel/CSV** – as data source (if applicable)


#   Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Imported energy consumption data from a structured file (e.g., Excel or CSV).
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Cleaned and shaped data using Power Query.
3. **Modeling**: Established relationships between tables and created calculated columns/measures using DAX.
4. **Visualization**: Built dynamic visuals including line charts, bar graphs, slicers, and KPIs.
   
#  Key Features

* **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter data by time, category, or region.
* **Trend Analysis**: Displays changes in energy usage over different time frames.
* **Peak Usage Detection**: Highlights high-consumption periods.

#  Insights & Conclusion

* Significant spikes in energy usage were observed during weekday mornings and late evenings.
* Certain departments or regions show consistently higher consumption, indicating potential inefficiencies.
